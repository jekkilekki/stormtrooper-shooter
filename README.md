# Star Wars Stormtrooper Shooter
A simple Star Wars game made with CSS and JavaScript.

I made this in 3 hours one morning before work.

### Options:

1. Choose Rebels or Empire
2. Shoot the opposite side's forces
3. Wrack up points, calculate accuracy, shots fired, etc.
4. Various point values for each character (due to varing speeds)
5. Select location (5 choices)
